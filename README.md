# Playwright-Screenplay-Demo
This repository contains an automated testing suite for the Sauce Demo e-commerce website, crafted using Playwright with TypeScript and the Screenplay pattern. The suite demonstrates both front-end UI interactions and hypothetical API interactions to provide a robust example of automation best practices.

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to showcase various testing techniques in Playwright, utilising the Screenplay pattern to enhance readability and maintainability of the test code. I would like it to serve as a resource for testers and developers looking to deepen their understanding of browser-based automation and API testing strategies.

## Features

- **Front-End UI Testing**: Automated checks that perform various user interactions with the Sauce Demo website.
- **API Interaction**: Examples of how API tests could be integrated using Playwright.
- **Screenplay Pattern**: Implementation of the Screenplay pattern to organise test scripts in a highly readable and modular format.
